**Backend-First Engineer | Independent Full-Stack Product Builder**

---

## Overview

I am a backend-first engineer who builds full-stack systems with a strong focus on architecture, clarity, and real-world problem solving.

In the past, I have worked closely with founders to translate operational complexity into structured backend workflows and production-ready software. My approach combines system thinking, AI-assisted development, and disciplined engineering practices.

I prioritize clean architecture, documentation, and long-term maintainability.

## Engineering Philosophy

* Backend systems should be predictable, modular, and well-documented
* Documentation is part of the product, not an afterthought
* AI tools enhance productivity, but architecture requires discipline
* Clean code and strong data modeling reduce long-term operational cost
* Strong foundations in core programming principles guide implementation decisions


I believe structured workflows are the foundation of any scalable product, so I design software with scalability and workflow automation in mind.

## Core Expertise

### Backend

* Node.js (Express)
* API design
* MongoDB
* Redis
* Workflow-driven backend architecture
* Structured AI integration pipelines

### Frontend

* React
* Next.js
* Tailwind CSS

## AI-Native Workflow Experience

I actively use AI-assisted development tools and have integrated AI-driven logic into backend systems where appropriate.

My experience includes:

* Designing structured input-to-output processing pipelines
* Building backend services that interact with LLMs
* Handling validation, transformation, and structured JSON outputs
* Designing modular services capable of integrating agentic components

I design systems with AI in mind, integrating it where it strengthens workflows and decision layers, while ensuring the core product architecture remains robust and deterministic.

## Product & Ownership Mindset

* Translated ambiguous founder requirements into clear backend flows
* Broke complex problems into structured data models and service layers
* Maintained clean repository structure and environment-based configuration
* Prioritized code quality, clarity, and maintainability

I am comfortable operating in startup-style environments where ownership, discipline, and execution matter.

## What I’m Seeking

I am seeking a full-stack developer role where I can lead backend system design, integrate AI-driven components, and take end-to-end ownership of meaningful product challenges.

I value environments that emphasize engineering discipline, documentation-first workflows, and thoughtful system design.



Thank you for reviewing my work.
